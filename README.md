# K-Armed Bandit
This is a Python implementation of the simulation done in chapter 2.3 of the book [Reinforcement Learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf).  
Keep in mind that running it with standard values will take a long time!  
This implementation includes the approach of reducing epsilon over time, as described in the book.
